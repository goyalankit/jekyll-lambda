',' acts as a delimeter for tuple.
print 1,000,000
1 0 0


'is' is by reference in Python

python strings are immutable

string builder equivalent in python.

Python doesn't have a switch

```python
Check: python caches numbers from -5 to 255

a = 12312313
c = 12312313

a is c #False

a = 12
c = 12

a is c #True
```
